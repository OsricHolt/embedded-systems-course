Notes: Measurements
1. Last activity of thread -> SysTick Begin = 375ns; .375us * 50 ticks*MHz = 20 ticks
2. SysTick duration = 4.25 us; 4.25us * 50 ticks*MHz = 212 ticks
3. Context Switching Time = 5.2us; 5.2us * 50 ticks*MHz = 260 ticks
4. Longest time outside idle Thread = 18us; 18us * 50 ticks*MHz = 900 ticks
5. RTOS overhead = 5.2us / 1e6us * 100 ticks = .00052 = 0.052% of program
