Notes:
The main loop is the "Background" loop while the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is the "Foreground"
Just like lesson 20, make shared variables volatile and disable interrupts when changing shared variables
Operations with strict time constraints must be in foreground since background timing is inconsistent
