// Notes: We context switch by hand
// 1. use our fake stack pointer and paste it into SP to enter thread 1
// 2. We save our new stack pointer and R4-R11 into stack 1 and then enter thread 2
// 3. Repeat step 2 for stack 2 and then paste stack pointer 1 back into SP to resume thread 1 where we left off
// Repeat steps 2 and 3
